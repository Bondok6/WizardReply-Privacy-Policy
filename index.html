    <h1>WizardReply Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p><em>Last updated: October 16, 2024</em></p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>WizardReply ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we
      collect, use, and share information when you use our Chrome extension, WizardReply (the "Extension").</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The Extension collects the following information:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Email message content: When you use the Extension to generate a reply, we temporarily access the content of
        the email you're responding to.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information we collect solely for the purpose of generating AI-powered email replies. Specifically:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The email message content is sent to OpenAI's API to generate an appropriate reply.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage and Retention</h2>
    <p>We do not store your email content or any other personal data. The email content is temporarily held in a
      variable only for the duration necessary to generate a reply and is then immediately discarded.</p>

    <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>We share the email content with OpenAI for the purpose of generating replies. We do not sell, rent, or otherwise
      share your information with any other third parties.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>As we do not store your data, there are no user controls for data management within the Extension. You can
      control what data is processed by choosing when to use the Extension.</p>

    <h2>7. Security</h2>
    <p>We prioritize the security of your information. However, please be aware that no method of electronic storage or
      transmission over the internet is 100% secure.</p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy
      Policy on this page and updating the "Last updated" date.</p>

    <h2>9. Contact Us</h2>
